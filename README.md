I’m excited to share my latest project: a Summary Generator from Websites! 🎉
It is capable of generating summary of Youtube videos too, but unfortunately due to some bugs or error in library or some kind of youtube policies it's it's temporarily not working.(** only for youtube videos)

🌟 Project Highlights:

Purpose: The tool scrapes content from any website and generates clear, concise summaries, making it easier for users to get the main insights quickly.
Tech Stack: Built with Langchain and Python to streamline the process, utilizing the GROQ_API for advanced query handling and summary generation.
Key Feature: Simply input a website URL, and the system instantly provides a summary that captures the most important details.
Challenges Tackled: Navigating complex web structures, fine-tuning the integration with Langchain to ensure accurate and relevant summaries.
